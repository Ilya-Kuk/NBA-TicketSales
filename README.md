# NBA-TicketSales
Project for Data Analytics

Professor Heiner is working on Ticket Sale data for the NBA. I was tasked with creating decision trees. After reading Chapter 8 in the ISLR book, I am growing trees using several methods, given several updated datasets, and a corresponding 'data dictionary'.

The datasets were given in this order:

  (With data dictionary)
  
  1. nbaTKTS3teams35095unkdelprezeros.csv
  2. nbaTKTS4teams0412_sample.csv
  
  (Slightly modified data - ax_ and la_ variables to be discarded, new response variable that is identical to the last!)
  
  3. nbasample2GrpPlus0429.csv
